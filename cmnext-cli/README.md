# cmnext-cli 
*A .NET cross-platform command-line tool that helps you manage your cms.*

## Motivation
I want to easily manage documentation from git repositories to compile markdown files into html, then from the command line, I can easily publish to a CMNext server. It would also generally be useful to have a command line tool to manage content anyway.

## Builds
Debug build w/ symbols & xml docs, release builds, NuGet packages, and individually packaged source code are available on my website (link below).  

## Docs and Guides
Documentation, specifications, and setup guides are available on my website.
